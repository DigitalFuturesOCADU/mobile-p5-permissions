{
  "name": "p5.phone",  // Change from "mobile-p5-permissions"
  "version": "1.4.4",
  "description": "Simplified mobile hardware access for p5.js - sensors, microphone, and gesture control"
}
```

**B. Main Library Files**

- Update CONTRIBUTING.md
- Rename YAML file: `mobile-p5-permissions.yaml` → `p5.phone.yaml`

**D. npm Publishing**
- Publish new package as `p5.phone` (or similar available name)
- Note: `p5.phone` may be taken; alternatives: `p5-phone`, `p5.mobile`, `p5phone`

---

### 2. 🖼️ **CREATE FEATURED IMAGE**

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Required Specifications:**

- **Dimensions:** 1500 x 1000 pixels (exactly)
- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **Content:** High-resolution, colored image showcasing the library
- **File Name:** `p5.phone.png` (or match your library name)

**Current Asset:**
- ✅ You have `P5Phone.png` - **verify it meets 1500x1000px requirement**

**Alt Text Needed:**
```yaml
featuredImageAlt: "Mobile phone displaying a p5.js sketch with on-screen debug panel showing motion sensor data and touch controls"
```

---

### 3. 📄 **CREATE LIBRARY YAML FILE**

**Priority:** HIGH  
**File Name:** `p5.phone.yaml`  
**Current File:** `mobile-p5-permissions.yaml` (needs updating)

**Required Format:**

```yaml
name: "p5.phone"
category: "hardware"  # Changed from "utils" - better fit for mobile hardware
description: "Simplified mobile hardware access for p5.js - handle sensors, microphone, touch, and browser gestures with ease."
author:
  name: "Nick Puckett"
  url: "https://digitalfuturesocad.ca"  # Or your preferred URL
sourceUrl: "https://github.com/DigitalFuturesOCADU/mobile-p5-permissions"
websiteUrl: "https://digitalfuturesocadu.github.io/P5-Phone-Interactions/"
npm: "p5.phone"  # Or whatever name is available
npmFilePath: "dist/p5.phone.min.js"
featuredImage: "p5.phone.png"
featuredImageAlt: "Mobile phone displaying a p5.js sketch with on-screen debug panel showing motion sensor data and touch controls"
license: "MIT"
```

**Category Recommendation:**
- Current: `utils`
- **Recommended: `hardware`** - Better fits mobile sensor access
- Alternative: `ui` (if focusing on gesture blocking)

---

### 4. 📚 **DOCUMENTATION ENHANCEMENTS**

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Current Status:** Good documentation, but needs refinement

#### A. Library Overview Section

Add to README.md (top section after title):

```markdown
# p5.phone

p5.phone is a p5.js addon library that simplifies mobile web development by handling:
- 📱 Device motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)
- 🎤 Microphone access
- 👆 Touch events
- 🚫 Browser gesture blocking
- 🐛 On-screen debugging

Perfect for creative coding, interactive installations, and mobile-first web experiences.
```

#### B. Quick Start Section

Add prominent "Quick Start" before "Basic Setup":

```markdown
## Quick Start

1. Include p5.phone in your HTML:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5.phone/dist/p5.phone.min.js"></script>
```

2. Use in your sketch:
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  lockGestures();
  enableGyroTap();
}
```

Done! Your sketch can now use device sensors.
```

#### C. API Reference Link

Create separate `API.md` or keep comprehensive reference in README (current approach is good)

---

### 5. 🎨 **EXAMPLES ORGANIZATION**

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Current Status:** Good examples exist, but organization needs refinement

#### Recommended Structure:

```
examples/
├── README.md              # Overview of all examples
├── 01-basic-touch/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── sketch.js
│   └── README.md
├── 02-motion-sensors/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── sketch.js
│   └── README.md
├── 03-microphone/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── sketch.js
│   └── README.md
├── 04-debug-panel/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── sketch.js
│   └── README.md
└── 05-complete-demo/
    ├── index.html
    ├── sketch.js
    └── README.md
```

**Action Items:**
- ✅ Current examples are good, just need individual READMEs
- Create `examples/README.md` listing all examples with live demo links
- Ensure all examples use the new `p5.phone` library name

---

### 6. 🔧 **BUILD SCRIPT UPDATES**

**Priority:** HIGH  
**File:** `package.json`

**Update build script to use new names:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx terser src/p5.phone.js --compress --mangle --output dist/p5.phone.min.js && cp src/p5.phone.js dist/p5.phone.js",
    "test": "echo \"No tests specified\" && exit 0",
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run build",
    "prepare": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

## Naming Convention Compliance

### ✅ **Following p5.js Standards:**

1. **File Naming:** 
   - ✅ `p5.phone.js` (lowercase after p5. prefix)
   - ✅ `p5.phone.min.js` (minified version)

2. **Class/Method Naming:**
   - ✅ Methods use `camelCase` (e.g., `enableGyroTap()`, `lockGestures()`)
   - ✅ No classes currently exposed (all prototype methods - good!)

3. **Global Variables:**
   - ⚠️ Using `window.sensorsEnabled` - consider namespacing: `window.p5phone.sensorsEnabled`
   - Current approach is acceptable but consider wrapping in object

## Questions to Resolve

### npm Package Name
**Current:** `mobile-p5-permissions`  
**Desired:** `p5.phone`  

**Check npm availability:**
```bash
npm search p5.phone
npm search p5-phone
npm search p5phone
```

**Options:**
1. `p5.phone` (preferred)
2. `p5-phone` (acceptable)
3. `p5phone` (acceptable)
4. `p5.mobile` (alternative)

### Category Selection
**Current:** `utils`  
**Recommended:** `hardware`  
**Alternative:** `ui`

**Rationale for "hardware":**
- Library primarily interfaces with device hardware (sensors, mic)
